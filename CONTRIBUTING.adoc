== Pull requests only

*DON'T* push to the master branch directly. Always use pull requests and
let people discuss changes in pull request.

Pull requests should only be merged after all discussions have been
concluded and at least 2 reviewers gave their approvals.

== Changelog for major changes

When your pull request does major changes, please also add an entry to
the changelog.

== Rule IDs

Each of the rules has an unique ID. A Rule ID is immutable and durable. It
doesn't change until the content of the rule changes significantly so that
it does not make sense to identify it with the old Rule ID.

In order to ensure the uniqueness of the IDs you can use `make check-rules`.
Preferably, you add this command as a `pre-commit` hook to your local
repository.

To generate a new unique Rule ID simply run `make next-rule-id`.
